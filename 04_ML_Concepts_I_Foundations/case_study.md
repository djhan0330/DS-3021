# Dongju's Case Study Responses

## What Problems are facing the organization?

### The organization is trying to solve the widespread issue: billions of dollars being wasted annually in the United States education system on software that fails to meet the unique needs, skills, and contexts of individual schools within district.

## What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?

### The target variable is the software, and the type of target variable is classification since the system will categorize the variable as either suitable or not suitable. In other words, it will be discrete. 

## How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?

### The organization would know that the solution was working if the responses had a higher likert scale.The survey asks questions such as teacher preparedness, technology infrastructure and proficiency, and administrative support, and if those scale have a higher overall score, it would mean that the students or teachers have a higher satisfaction among the school software. 

## What other issues might the team be facing?

### The organization currently have limited and low quality data as the survey responses contain response biases. The organization has to gather more data to make a more accurate model. Furthermore,the system will need to create a model that accounts for the nuances of each district. 

## How difficult is the data to gather?

### In order to avoid sampling bias, the non-profit organization collected data from several school districts in different regions and ensured diversity by allowing no district to have more than 100 responses. This process is extensively difficult as a non-profit organization as they have to ask numerous schools to complete their survey with sincerity. 

## Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?

### The target, which is finding the ideal software for students, could be difficult to measure as there are various aspects to examine. However, I believe that it will be easy for the target to break into smaller parts such as technology proficiency or budget constraints. I believe that examining those smaller parts one at a time will lead to a more accurate and successful target.


## What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?

### As the majority of survey respondents are students (K-12), they might lack knowledge to answer some of the questions, which could lead to inaccurate data. Therefore, if the input data has inaccuracies, the output data would also consists of inaccuracies. In conclusion, there would be uncertainty to some extent, however, we should try our best to mitigate those uncertainties as much as possible.
